    <h1>Adrienne Bing</h1>
    <p>I am originally from Philadelphia, I lived there until I was
      21 years.  At the tender age of 21 I left my parents and sister behind
      and moved to Georgia.  While in school at DeVry University for Accounting
      I had to take a web class as an elective and I loved it so much
      that I switched my major to Computer information Systems. I have loved
      coding ever since.</p>

    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
